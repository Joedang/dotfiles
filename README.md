# dotfiles
Used to synchronize configuration files between my machines. 
Also used to store a few really handy scripts/commands.

Symbolically link to the things you (I) want like `ln -s ~/dotfiles/.bashrc ~/.bashrc`.
Don't forget to push and pull things appropriately, so you're (I'm) not caught without biz.
